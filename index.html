							<p>I'm Andrew, a software engineer living in Blacksburg, Virginia. I am a student at Virginia Tech and expect to graduate in May of 2017 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and minor in mathematics.</p>
							<p>I've been interested in software development ever since I borrowed a Java book from my father's bookshelf on a whim when I was sixteen. Since then, I have discovered a love and passion for the field that I have never felt for anything else.</p>
							<p>Since starting school at Tech, I have taken many computer science classes and, more importantly, worked two different jobs in the field. During the summer of 2014, I worked as a researcher for IT Security Lab here on campus. The following year, I was a software engineering intern for a company called Solers, Inc and will be returning there this May. There is a link to my complete resume at the bottom of the page.</p>
							<p>Over the years, I have worked on many small projects on my own time, though I rarely create anything presentable. It is my hope that creating this site as a sort of portfolio will inspire me to begin working on more polished and interesting projects.</p>
							<p>Outside of computer science, I am an Eagle Scout and avid rock climber. I also enjoy being outdoors in general, running, and cooking.</p>

							<p>The website you're looking at right now. I've never been much of a web developer, so when a friend mentioned creating a personal website as a portfolio himself, I realized that this would be a perfect opportunity to hone these skills.</p>
							<p>The site is hosted using GitHub's free hosting feature and uses a domain name also acquired for free. It's quite simple in its current state, featuring mostly basic HTML and CSS with a few jQuery features (try hovering over the links in the header if you haven't already).</p>
							<p>In its current state, the site is fully function but still a work in progress. I hope to add content and streamline it over time.</p>
